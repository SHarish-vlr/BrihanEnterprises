                                        <h4>C.S. Ramakrishnan (1937-2017)</h4>
                                        <p>C.S. Ramakrishnan was a remarkable leader who embodied the pursuit of both
                                            material success and spiritual fulfillment. Born in Kerala, India, in 1937,
                                            he moved to Tamil Nadu for his schooling and eventually completed his
                                            studies at the prestigious institution of SIES in Mumbai.</p>
                                        <p>Ramakrishnan's career began in 1957 in the financial services sector. He
                                            played a pivotal role in popularizing "fraternity funds," (a.k.a "Chit
                                            Funds") a novel savings instrument that empowered the Indian middle class.
                                            Known for his approachable personality, helpful nature, and innovative
                                            spirit, he challenged conventional wisdom and advocated for regulations to
                                            ensure the stability of the business. He actively participated in creating
                                            regulatory frameworks for the fraternity fund business, demonstrating his
                                            commitment to ethical practices.</p>

                                            founded Brihan Consultants in 1993. With a ground-breaking vision of making
                                            professional services in job seeking accessible, Brihan offered free
                                            services to job seekers, a unique concept at the time. The company quickly
